Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software system. It is important because it enables the creation of systems and applications that aid in the ease of various aspects of life such as communication (instagram),etc. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages - this is a milestone as it has made coding languages which have evolved from machine languages to higher level languages like java,c++,etc allowing the invention of various applications.
The advent of structured programming- there is now a structured blueprint that should be followed leading to an easier process of development.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline- a lot of people can get to learn its processes and get a chance to bring their own creative ideas to life through studing software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements
Design
Implementation
Testing
Deployment
Maintenance

Requirements involves understanding,gathering and documenting user needs and requirements. 
Design is creating a blueprint or detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation is writing the code and building the software using programming languages.
Testing involves carrying out various test to ensure the software performs the functions it was created for.
Deployment is releasing the software to users.
Maintenance is updating and improving the software overtime.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology has distinct phases where a phase must be completed before moving to the next whikle Agile Methodolgy is flexible and adaptable to chnaging requirements. In comparism waterfall methodology has an upfront and detailed planning, a fixed scope, late feedback and proactive risk managements while Agile methodology has continious planning, evovling scope, frequent feedback and reactive risk management.
In Contrast Waterfall methodology has sequential phases, rigid flexibility, heavy documetation and less customer focus while Agile methodology has iterative phases, good flexibility, minimal documetation and high customer feedback.
Example: An example of the waterfall methodology is the construction of a building from gathering information from the client, designing phase where the blueprint is gotten then construction phase begins. An example of the Agile methodology is developing a new website every. In every single iteration, the team would gather requirement, adjust,review progress and adjusting plan as needed.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - Responsible for writing codes and implementing softwares.
Quality Assurance - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager - Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments and Version Control Systems are important because they increase productivity by streamlining development processes and improving efficiency.
VCS aids better collaboration of teamwork and allows for efficient code sharing.
IDEs help identifying errors and VCS help track changes and prevent conflicts.
Examples: IDEs - Visual studio code, Xcode. VCS - GIT hub, Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements of project during development cycle.
Tight deadlines leading to compromised quality. 
Technical Debt can increase maintenance costs.
Strategistes to overcome these challenges inckude: Effective communication, Agile methodologies, Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing aims at testing individual units to verify correctness. It is important because it fix bugs early, improves code maintainablity and aids faster debugging.
Integration Testing is used to test the interaction between diffents units of a software system. It is important because it ensures components work well together, prevent system wide failures.
Systenm Testing evaluates the entire software system as a whole ensuring it meets the specified requirments. It is important because it ensures system's performance, reliability and security.
Acceptance Testing verifies that the software meets the needs and expectations of the end user. It is important because it ensures the software is ready for deployment and helps to build customer confidence and satisfaction. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting effective prompts or instructions to get the best possible responses from AI models. It is important in interacting with AI because it improves the accuracy and relevance of an AI model's response,it gives better understanding of the command and assist the AI in generating more accurate and informative esponses. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An exapmle of a vague prompt is 'Tell me about bags" while a good prompt is "Tell me about the hermes birkin bags". It is more effective because not only has the brand been specified but also the exact name of the bag has been specified and hermes is the only brand that produces birkin bags.
